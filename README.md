# Get-it-Done
A To-do-list website which adds and deletes tasks and stores the date of completion without using a database.
Almost all browsers have localstorage which stores the cache data which i have used . But using localstorage we can store a key and a value .
We actually ought to store Objects in place of value which stores the specific data for which i used an API know as IndexedDB.
IndexedDB Stores the data in cache memory using indexes which makes the application work faster.(i.e pushing and pulling data is brisk)
That's it ...! Open an IndexedDB with objectstores in it.Writing functions to do the CRUD operations and updating the HTML would be the only work to do.
Go On and check over my code. Thanks for visiting my profile.
